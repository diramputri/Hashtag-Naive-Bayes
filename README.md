## Hashtag Naive-Bayes

Turns out there is a lot of overlap between political and scientific tweets! This code was written in a style for students who are just learning about Naive Bayes in their machine learning courses. Comments in the code introduce the foundational method for the NB algorithm (presented here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/naive-bayes-classifiers/) and applies it to my little Twitter 'curiousity project.'

You can also apply this to other classification use cases. This algorithm performed so much better on classifying Positive and Negative Amazon reviews (F1 score: 0.9230769)
